# OASIS

OASIS was originally intended to be a client-server system for hosting one's own music streaming service - the server would store and serve music in mp3, flac, and other formats.  The client would have been able to play music from the server, "Sync" the music so that it could play offline, and would have a robust search-and-download feature allowing the user to search for and download music from a variety of sources (Youtube, LibreVox, Torrents, archive.org - the responsibility for making sure these downloads were legal was to be in the user's hands).

After playing around with MPD as the backend streaming server, and creating a very dumbed-down search engine that pulls from Youube and archive.org, I put this project on hold.  None of what I had was very usable, so I won't be uploading my progress so far.  I will resume this project when I get done with my degree. 

In the meantime, keep an eye on the STCE repo - I'll be making some commits on that project soon, and plan to use it as the background for my CAPSTONE project at WGU.
